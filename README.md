## REQUIREMENTS
This software requires `php5` and a compatible web server, for example `apache2` <br />
It also uses the `mail` php function that requires to configure `php.ini` properly. By default it should be configured to convey emails to an SMTP server on 127.0.0.1, to run the server, install the `postfix` package and run `service postfix start` on Debian like systems.

## API
`/api/` contains the code used to handle clients requests. 

These roughly are:
* report/contro-report site
* avoid-report/avoid-contro-report site
* download incremental updates from black/gray/white lists

## Reports Management
`/management/` contains the (now simple) system that *report's reviewers* shall use to review and judge reported sites.

## Issues and concerns
At the moment the system defines good, bad and just reported sites. The problem is that these three categories simply don't fit whatever site is in the net. Hence, at least a new category for sites that may be dangerous (because of user controlled content, like freely uploaded/downloaded executables) should be added to improve awareness of users that are surfing the web.
